# John Green Sasquatch Data #

This data is an export of the database provided by the late John Green from his sasquatch database.  The export his site provides does not included header information in the CSV files provided, and so I took the liberty of re-exporting the data to include the header information in the CSV files. 

The data was exported from the Access database provided on his site using [mdbtool](http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/mdbtools-gmdb).

The original database is located at [http://www.sasquatchdatabase.com/](http://www.sasquatchdatabase.com/).
